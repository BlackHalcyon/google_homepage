Mockup of google's homepage

Project started on November 13, 2020 by BlackHalcyon

The goal is to make the page look perfectly identical, including hover and clicking on the links.  No search function of course.  

On this project I am borrowing heavily from other coders, my primary aim is to see how the code goes together to affect the page in the way it does.
