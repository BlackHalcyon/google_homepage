Mock up of google's homepage

Project started on November 13, 2020 by BlackHalcyon

  On my previous project "searchengine_homepage," I put together all the code myself, only using tutorials to help me remember exact syntax and usage.  This time I am looking at more examples to try to learn some more common practices and see a different way to do things.  

Goals: 

Use less <div> and more classes this time to make the structure cleaner and clearer.  

Make the finished project look like a perfect copy of the real thing.
